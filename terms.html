As a Token holder, you'll have the power to propose and vote on proposals that will help to shape the future of the World Liberty Financial Protocol (the &ldquo;<span class="tw-text-secondary">WLF Protocol</span>&rdquo;). This includes decisions on marketing initiatives, future functionality, and more, as described further in the World Liberty Financial Gold Paper (the &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://static.worldlibertyfinancial.com/docs/gold-paper.pdf">Gold Paper</a>&rdquo;). $WLFI is currently functional for this utility as governance tokens.</p><h4>No Economic Rights</h4><p>The Tokens do not confer any rights, express or implied, other than the right to use the Token as a means to participate in governance of the WLF Protocol through the WLF Governance Platform. In particular, you understand and accept that the Token does not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights, or any right to receive any distribution, revenue share, additional tokens, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the WLF Protocol, and/or the Company and its corporate affiliates, other than rights to use for governance relating to the WLF Protocol, subject to limitations and conditions in these Terms and applicable WLF Protocol Terms and Policies (as defined below).</p><h4>Transferability</h4><p>$WLFI are non-transferable and accordingly may not be transferred or resold. Token holders approved a proposal in July 2025 to make the Tokens transferable, and the Company is expected to unlock tradability for a portion of $WLFI tokens sold to early purchasers subject to an unlock schedule. The remainder of the $WLFI tokens sold to early supporters is intended to be subject to a second vote by the community to determine the unlock and release schedule. Unlock schedules for initial founders, advisors, and others are expected to remain non-transferable, and in any case, subject to a longer unlock schedule. The Company retains discretion to determine the timing of and any eligibility requirements for unlocking the Tokens.</p><h4>The $WLFI Token and WLF Governance Platform are distinct from WLF Protocol</h4><p>The Token does not provide any economic or other rights with respect to the WLF Protocol or otherwise. As a result, you will not have any rights to any fees generated by the WLF Protocol or earned by the Company. You should not use, acquire or hold the Tokens with an expectation of Tokens increasing (or not decreasing) in value as a result of any future functionality or the success or failure of the WLF Protocol. You are not required to be a Token holder to use the WLF Protocol, but only Token holders can participate in the WLF Governance Platform. Use of the WLF Protocol is subject to terms of use of the WLF Protocol and include other disclosures relevant to users of the WLF Protocol.</p><p>The Tokens are not intended to be a digital currency, security, derivative, transferable crypto asset or any other kind of financial instrument, but you should be aware that the application of legacy financial and other regulation to new technology like the Tokens is uncertain and carries risk.</p><h3>2. Scope of Terms</h3><p>Unless otherwise stated herein, these Terms govern only your use, acquisition and/or holding of Tokens. The use of Tokens in connection with the WLF Protocol will be governed by the WLF Protocol Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other applicable terms and policies available at worldlibertyfinancial.com (collectively, the &ldquo;<span class="tw-text-secondary">WLF Protocol Terms and Policies</span>)&rdquo;. Any additional WLF Protocol Terms and Policies we promulgate will be available at worldlibertyfinancial.com. We may add terms or policies to the<!-- --> <span class="tw-text-secondary">WLF Protocol Terms and Policies</span> <!-- -->at our sole discretion and may update each of the WLF Protocol Terms and Policies from time to time according to modification procedures set forth therein. To the extent of any conflict with these Terms, the WLF Protocol Terms and Policies shall control with respect to any issues relating to the use of Tokens in connection with the WLF Protocol.</p><h3>3. Eligibility</h3><h4>Eligibility Requirements</h4><p>In order to be eligible to use, acquire or hold Tokens, you must provide all information as required by the Company or its agents as part of its screening process to seek to ensure that (i) no specially designated nationals or other persons sanctioned by FinCEN are permitted to use, acquire or $WLFI, and (ii) only eligible persons can use, acquire or hold Tokens. We have engaged third party service providers to collect and verify information on our behalf, who may also require you to accept their terms and conditions or privacy policy agreements.</p><h4>Technical Requirements</h4><p>In order to be eligible to use, acquire or hold the Tokens, you must also control a software application or hardware device that securely manages your public and private keys related to a blockchain address (a &ldquo;<span class="tw-text-secondary">Wallet</span>&rdquo;) that supports ERC native tokens on the Ethereum Mainnet and provide the public key for your Wallet if requested. We reserve the right to prescribe additional guidance regarding specific requirements with respect to a storage mechanism for the Tokens.</p><p>The Company prohibits any and all use, sales or transfers of Tokens to users domiciled or located in a country or territory it deems as restricted from any Token-related activities or are subject to other regulatory requirements, including but not limited to Afghanistan, Congo-Brazzaville, Congo-Kinshasa, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Tajikistan. The Company may cancel any sales or transfers to users domiciled or located in any such country and may seek to block such users from accessing the Tokens.</p><h3>4. Token and Voting Specifications</h3><h4>Quantity of Tokens:</h4><p>The Company has generated 100 billion $WLFI as native tokens on the Ethereum blockchain for use with the WLF Protocol.</p><h4>Voting Ownership Limitation</h4><p>All $WLFI will have equal voting power within the WLF Protocol, but no persons may vote in excess of 5% of the outstanding votable Token supply regardless of the number of $WLFI held, subject to community voting and governance proposals. Accordingly, you and your affiliated persons should not seek to acquire more than 5% of the outstanding votable Token supply. Because some Tokens will be held in treasury and are non-votable, and founding team Tokens are also subject to the 5% token voting limitation, the Company anticipates the votable Token supply will be less than the total Token supply, though this number is subject to change.</p><h3>5. Acknowledgment and Assumption of Risks</h3><p>You acknowledge and agree that there are risks associated with acquiring, holding and using Tokens, including, without limitation, these disclosed and explained in the Risk Disclosures available<!-- --> <a href="risk-disclosures.html">here</a>.

Even if we refer you to third-party wallet solutions, we are not responsible for the adequacy of their services or software, or for any such losses. You will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to secure access to (i) any device connected with the email address associated with your account, (ii) private keys required to access any relevant Ethereum address or your Tokens and (iii) your username, password and any other login or identifying credentials, including those used by $WLFI service providers.</p><h3>7.

You agree to provide us, or our nominee, such information promptly upon request, and you acknowledge that you may not be able to use, transfer, acquire or hold Tokens until you provide such requested information and we have determined that your use, acquisition, transfer or holding of Tokens is permissible under applicable law or regulation.</p><p>We may use aggregate statistical information about your activity, including your activity on the Company Site and logins to various websites, for marketing or any other purpose at our sole discretion, in accordance with our Privacy Policy or any other WLF Protocol Terms and Policies.

Taxes</h3><p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your any acquisition or holding of Tokens, including, for example, sales, use, value added, and similar taxes. It is also your responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. We are not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting or remitting any sales, use, value added or similar tax arising from your use, acquisition or holding of Tokens. You agree not to hold the Company or any WLF Protocol Parties (as defined below in Section 10) liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the creation, ownership, use or liquidation of Tokens, or any other action or transaction related to the WLF Protocol.</p><h3>9.

DT Marks DeFi, LLC and its affiliates, including Donald J. Trump have received a fixed grant of 22,500,000,000 $WLFI tokens and are entitled to 75% of net protocol revenues as defined in a services agreement to include revenue to World Liberty Financial from any sources, after deduction of agreed reserves, agreed expenses and other amounts.

Instead, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court). Disputes subject to this provision include, without limitation, those arising from or related to (a) these Terms or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof; (b) any and all products or services sold, distributed or provided by the Company; and (c) any and all interactions or transactions between the Parties, whether heretofore or hereafter arising.</p><h4>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions, or Representative or Collective Actions</h4><p>Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and the Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative or collective proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p><h4>Informal Dispute Resolution</h4><p>The following must occur prior to and as a condition precedent to commencing a formal arbitration under these Terms. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises or becomes known, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.

If either Party is represented by counsel, that Party's counsel may participate in the dispute resolution conference, but the Party also must appear at and participate in the conference.</p><p>The Parties agree that any relevant limitations periods and arbitral fee(s) or other deadlines will be tolled during the sixty (60) day informal dispute resolution period. After this sixty (60) day period, the relevant limitations periods and filing fee(s) or deadlines are no longer tolled until filing is effectuated under this Section. If you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within the informal dispute resolution period and after participating in the mandatory dispute resolution conference, then either you or the Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in this Section, file a claim in court.</p><h4>Arbitration Process</h4><p>Except as otherwise provided in this Section for disputes concerning the use of intellectual property and those eligible to be heard in small claims court, any and all Disputes between the Parties, including without limitation those arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be resolved through binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;<span class="tw-text-secondary">AAA</span>&rdquo;) under its applicable rules and procedures including, where applicable, its Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Arbitration Rules, and Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and their attendant procedures and fee schedules.

The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. &sect; 1 et seq., &ldquo;<span class="tw-text-secondary">FAA</span>&rdquo;) and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" subsection of these Terms as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. IF WE HAVE A DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WHETHER IT IS VALID, CAN BE ENFORCED, OR APPLIES TO OUR DISPUTE, THAT DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED IN ARBITRATION.</p><p>Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Parties shall each be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs associated with the arbitration.</p><h4>Mass Arbitrations</h4><p>In the event that 25 or more individual claims are filed by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated, counsel for the claimants and counsel for the respondent shall each select five (5) cases (per side) to proceed in individual arbitral proceedings as part of a batching process. Any remaining claims that have complied with the procedures in this Section shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims, until they are selected to be filed as part of this batching process. At the outset of disputes under this provision, you and the Company agree to delegate to a Process Arbitrator all matters listed as within the scope of a Process Arbitrator's authority under the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as well as disagreements concerning the validity, enforceability, and applicability of these terms, and any other matters that the parties mutually agree to delegate.</p><p>During the batching process, a single arbitrator shall preside over each batch of cases. After decisions have been rendered in the first ten (10) cases, the Company and all claimants shall engage in a global mediation in an attempt to resolve the remaining cases with the benefit of the decisions in the first batch of cases. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the mediation, each side shall select another ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitral proceedings as part of a second batching process. The parties may, but are not required to, agree in writing to modify the number of cases to be included at each stage of the batching process. After decisions have been rendered in this second batch of cases, the Company and all claimants shall engage in a second global mediation in an attempt to resolve the remaining cases with the benefit of the decisions in the first two (2) batches of cases. If the Parties have not resolved the remaining disputes at the close of the second global mediation, the Company or any individual claimant(s) whose claim has not been adjudicated may elect to opt out of arbitration by providing notice to the other Party, and if the claimant or the Company wishes to proceed with the claim they may file an individual (non-class, non-representative) action in court. If the Company or any claimant(s) do not opt out, those remaining claims will proceed in arbitration in continued batches of one-hundred (100) claimants per batch (to the extent there are fewer than one-hundred (100) claimants outstanding, a final batch will consist of the remaining claimants). This batching process shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing class or representative arbitration or litigation of any kind. In order to increase the efficiency of the administration and resolution of arbitrations, and if consistent with the relevant rules and procedures, the arbitral tribunal shall: (i) designate a single arbitrator for each batch; (ii) provide for a single filing fee due per side per batch; and (iii) allow joint conferences and joint hearings, and such other coordinated procedures as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The applicable limitations period(s) and filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for each claim subject to this Section from the time that the arbitral filing requirements are satisfied with respect to that claim. A court shall have authority to enforce these mass arbitration provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin a court or arbitral filing in violation thereof.</p><h4>Severability of Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h4><p>The agreement to arbitrate contained in this Section shall continue in full force and effect despite the expiration or termination of these or other related terms. If any term, clause or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</p><h3>15. Governing Law and Venue</h3><p>This Agreement, and all questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation thereof, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The arbitration agreement in these Terms is governed by the FAA, including its procedural provisions, in all respects. State arbitration laws do not govern in any respect. Further, you and the Company each agree that the Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and will be governed by and construed in accordance with federal law to the fullest extent possible. Any Dispute between the Parties arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved and filed only in the courts of the State of Florida. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.</p><h3>16. Severability</h3><p>If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid, void, or unenforceable (in whole or in part), then such term, clause, or provision shall be severable from these Terms without affecting the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision in these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable provisions will be interpreted to affect the intent of the original provisions. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be severed from these Terms, but the rest of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p><h3>17.
